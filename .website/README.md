Can you bring them back together before the moon sets and darkness falls? 🌙

### About the level generation and difficulty

- All levels are randomly generated
- Each level is solvable within the move limit (once there is a move limit). Exception: If you see a `?` for the move limit, it means no valid level was found after 13 tries — this should be very rare.
- The displayed difficulty is based on the number of solutions (how many paths lead to victory)
- The full version of the game uses a more advanced difficulty system that slowly scales with your XP 🧶, but I had to simplify this to save some bytes
- Speaking of 🧶, it's a simple XP system:
    - Win: `+10 🧶`
    - Difficulty bonus: `+0 / +1 / +3`
    - Extra moves left: `+ leftover moves`
    - Retries: `- retries`
- You can "buy" a hint with 5 🧶
    - This will highlight the best possible next move or show a retry button if no move can lead to victory
